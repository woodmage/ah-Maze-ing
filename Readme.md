Ah-MAZE-ing!  Copyright 2023 by John Worthington (woodmage@gmail.com)

This is a rather simple maze generation program.  It has two controls that let you adjust the width and height of the maze.  It also has a Generate button to let you make the maze, a Save Pic button to let you save the picture it made, and a Save Map button that saves the maze as ASCII characters.  It also has a Quit button.  It is capable of producing extremely large mazes rather quickly.

Possible future additions: I dunno.  Maybe I'll add in different maze algorithms since I have been looking at those lately.  Perhaps something for sparseness.  If you have any ideas or (GASP!) bug reports, send them to woodmage@gmail.com and please make the subject matter Ah-maze-ing!  Enjoy!
